May 2019 – Jun 2019

Project description

• Tested all the data in the test database with K nearest neighbors and took decisions by majority polling.

• Implemented Learning Curve to analyze model performance and got better insights about variance and bias

• Implemented KNN with different distance metrics like Eucledian, Manhattan, Minkowski, and Mahalanobis.
